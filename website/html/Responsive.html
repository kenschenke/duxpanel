<h2>Responsive Panels</h2>

<p>
    <code>&lt;DuxPanel&gt;</code> is designed to be responsive from Desktop browsers down to mobile devices. This is
    accomplished using a set of sizing breakpoints similar to Twitter's
    <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> CSS framework.
</p>

<h4>Sizing Breakpoints</h4>

<p>
    There are five sizing breakpoints, defined to be exactly the same as Bootstrap.  This simplifies web page design
    if your site is already using Bootstrap.  These breakpoints are:
</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Breakpoint</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>xs</td>
        <td>Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>sm</td>
        <td>Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>md</td>
        <td>Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>lg</td>
        <td>Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>xl</td>
        <td>Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Dimensions and Placement</h4>

<p>
    Panels are sized and located on the web page using one of three possible values: a number (actual pixels),
    a percent, or an object detailing sizes at specific breakpoints.  If an object is supplied, the size at each
    breakpoint can be a number (actual pixels) or a percent.  These values are recognized in the
    <code>&lt;DuxPanel&gt;</code> properties of <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>width</code>,
    and <code>height</code>.  Here are some examples of this:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;DuxPanel width="50%" height={150} top={50}&gt;...&lt;/DuxPanel&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    Sizes and placement in breakpoints look like this:
</p>

<pre>
    const width = {
        xs: "100%",
        sm: "90%",
        md: 400   // Numbers or percents can be used for each breakpoint
    };

    &lt;DuxPanel width={width} ...
</pre>

<p>
    Notice the width object is missing <code>lg</code> and <code>xl</code>.  If a size breakpoint is missing from
    the object, the breakpoint for the next smallest screen is used.  In this case, browsers with large or extra-large
    windows would fall back to the medium breakpoint.  If the browser window is the <code>xs</code> size and that
    breakpoint is missing from the object, the next lowest breakpoint is used instead.
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>
    These two examples demonstrate a proportionally sized panel and one that changes its sizes using the responsive
    breakpoints.
