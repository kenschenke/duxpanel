<h2>Panel Animation</h2>

<p>
    <code>&lt;DuxPanel&gt;</code> supports CSS animation.  All modern evergreen browsers (such as Firefox and Chrome)
    support CSS animation as well as Internet Explorer 10 or later.  Simple entry and exit animations are built-in as well
    as support for keyframes and the CSS shorthand animation syntax.
</p>

<h4>Entry and Exit Animations</h4>

<p>
    <code>&lt;DuxPanel&gt;</code> offers optional entry and exit animations.
    The following properties control animations when a panel is opening and closing.  <code>slideInFrom</code> and
    <code>slideOutFrom</code> forces <code>fadeIn</code> and <code>fadeOut</code> to <strong>true</strong>.
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Default</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>fadeIn</td>
        <td>false (true in DuxDialog)</td>
        <td>True if the panel and the backdrop fade in</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>fadeOut</td>
        <td>false (true in DuxDialog)</td>
        <td>True if the panel and the backdrop fade out</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>slideInFrom</td>
        <td>none ("top" in DuxDialog)</td>
        <td>"top", "left", "bottom", or "right"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>slideOutTo</td>
        <td>none ("top" in DuxDialog)</td>
        <td>"top", "left", "bottom", or "right"</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h4>CSS Animation</h4>

<p>
    For more complete control over animation, CSS animations are supported.  The <code>animation</code> property
    contains an animation shorthand referencing <code>@keyframes</code> specified in the CSS.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    If your animation modifies the CSS <code>top</code> or <code>left</code> properties, users will not be able to
    drag the panel as long as the <code>animation</code> property to DuxPanel is non-empty.
